# Symfony3 - Angular2

I try to combine Symfony3 and Angular2 from scratch and with the [Angular Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html). 
It works with Apache, however, the deep linking is not available but will be soon... I'm working on it!

## Getting started
In the folder "/config/vhosts", you can find the .conf file for Apache, which enables Angular to call Symfony web services on the "/api" route.

Don't forget to run the following commands:
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

To auto-compile typescript files, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

I hope you will enjoy it!
